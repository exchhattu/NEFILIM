# NEFILIM

NEFILIM is iterative fragment-assembly de novo protein structure program. 
It generates a new set of fragments from the lowest energy de novo models. 
Subsequently, the fragments are further used in prediction. NEFILIM showed better 
performance in comparison. NEFILIM was also tested in CASP11.
